Image upload strategy:

  1) Everything is public, stored in /public/ but the path to an image is controlled by private hashed key.

  2) The path to a file is stored in the database.

Downside:

  Everything is public, sharing the link to an images defeats lightweight access control on per-user-basic.

  - On the other hand, none of the data here is really 'super private' and guessing a long-hash
    is about as likely as guessing a password; ie. impossible. So once an image is 'public' it
    is basically public to everyone; this is acceptable.


  Deleting files requires the extra step of deleting the actual object on the file system.

  - Not really a big deal.


Upside:

  Easy

  Fast
  
  Plugable to other storage solutions (S3)
